# Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! This is a portfolio website built using **HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript** to showcase my projects and skills.

## Overview
This website serves as my personal portfolio, where I display my work, projects, and background. It is still a work in progress, and it is not yet optimized for mobile devices.

## Features
- **Clean and modern layout**
- **Responsive design (in progress)**
- **Project showcase section**
- **Contact information**

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structuring the website
- **CSS** for styling and layout
- **JavaScript** for minor interactivity

## Credits
The layout of my website is heavily inspired by [GreatStack](https://greatstack.dev). While I followed the format and design closely, I wrote all the code myself from scratch without copying any of their source code.

## ðŸ”§ Future Improvements
